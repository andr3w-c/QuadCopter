# QuadCopter
Code for my quadcopter project

rpi server.py - code runs on a raspberry pi zero w mounted on a quadcopter. The rpi talks to the flight controller over UART giving it navigation commands based on communication with PC client. 

pcclient.py - python code runs on windows computer. talks to rpi over ad-hoc wifi connection.
